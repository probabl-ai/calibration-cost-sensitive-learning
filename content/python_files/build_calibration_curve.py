# # What is a calibration curve?
#
# Before we dive into how to interpret a calibration curve, let's start by getting
# intuitions on what it graphically represents. In this exercise, you will build your
# own calibration curve.
#
# To simplify the process, we only focus on the output of a binary classifier but
# without going into details on the model used to generate the predictions. We later
# discuss the implications of the data modeling process on the calibration curve.
#
# So let's first generate some predictions. The generative process is located in the
# file `_generate_predictions.py`. This process stores the true labels and the
# predicted probability estimates of several models into the `predictions` folder.

# %%
# Make sure to have scikit-learn >= 1.5
import sklearn
sklearn.__version__

# %%
# Equivalent to the magic command "%run _generate_predictions.py" but it allows this
# file to be executed as a Python script.

ipython = get_ipython()

#
# Let's load a the true labels and the predicted probabilities of one of the models.

# %%
import numpy as np

y_true = np.load("../predictions/y_true.npy")
y_prob = np.load("../predictions/y_prob_2.npy")

# %%
y_true

# %% [markdown]
#
# `y_true` contains the true labels. In this case, we face a binary classification
# problem.

# %%
y_prob

# %% [markdown]
#
# `y_prob` contains the predicted probabilities of the positive class estimated by a
# given model.
#
# As discussed earlier, we could evaluate the discriminative power of the model using
# a metric such as the ROC-AUC score.

# %%
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

print(f"ROC AUC: {roc_auc_score(y_true, y_prob):.2f}")

# %% [markdown]
#
# The score is much above 0.5 and it means that our model is able to discriminate
# between the two classes. However, this score does not tell us if the predicted
# probabilities are well calibrated.
#
# We can provide an example of a well-calibrated probability: for a given sample, the
# predicted probabilities is considered well-calibrated if the proportion of samples
# where this probability is predicted is equal to the probability itself.
#
# It is therefore possible to group predictions into bins based on their predicted
# probabilities and to calculate the proportion of positive samples in each bin and
# compare it to the average predicted probability in the bin.
#
# Scikit-learn provide a utility to plot this graphical representation. It is available
# through the class `sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay`.

# ## Exercise:
#
# As a pedagogical exercise, we will build the calibration curve from scratch. This
# will help us understand the underlying process. The calibration curve is built by
# following these steps:
#
# 1. Bin the predicted probabilities (i.e. `y_prob`) into 10 bins. You can use the
#    `pd.cut` function from the `pandas` library. It will return a `Categorical`
#    object where we get the bin identifier for each sample.

#
# 2. Create a DataFrame with the true labels, predicted probabilities, and bin
#    identifier.

# TODO

# %% [markdown]
#
# 3. Group the DataFrame by the bin identifier and calculate the mean of the true
#    labels and the predicted probabilities.

#
# 4. Plot the calibration curve by plotting the average predicted probabilities
#    against the fraction of positive samples.

#
# Scikit-learn also provides a parameter `strategy` that is the strategy to adopt to
# create the bins. By default, we used the `"uniform"` strategy. However, it can happen
# that only few samples are present in some bins, leading to a noisy calibration curve.
#
# The strategy `"quantile"` ensures that each bin has the same number of samples. We
# can show it on our previous example:


# %%
disp = CalibrationDisplay.from_predictions(
    y_true, y_prob, n_bins=n_bins, strategy="quantile"
)
_ = disp.ax_.set(xlim=(0, 1), ylim=(0, 1), aspect="equal")

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Exercise:
#
# Modify your previous implementation such that `pd.cut` uses quantiles to create the
# bins instead of the default uniform behaviour. Specifically, look at the `bins`
# parameter in `pd.cut` and the function `np.quantile` to compute the quantile from
# the predicted probabilities in `y_prob` to create the bins.

# %%
# TODO

# %% [markdown]
#
# ## Solution:

# %%
bins = np.quantile(y_prob, np.linspace(0, 1, n_bins))
bin_identifier = pd.cut(y_prob, bins=bins)
predictions = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "y_true": y_true,

# # Cost-sensitive learning to optimize business metrics
#
# Many real-world applications of machine learning aim to automate operational
# decisions with access to partial contextual information. This requires
# designing a decision policy that is optimal with respect to some given
# "utility function" or "business metric". The aim is therefore to maximize a
# gain or minimize a cost that is related to the decision taken by the system
# (for instance accept or reject a transaction) prior to the observation of a
# delayed outcome (discovering that the transaction was legitimate or
# fraudulent) modeled as a target random variable conditioned on observed
# contextual information.
#
# In this tutorial, we explore the concrete example of fraud detection in
# credit card transactions. We first describe the dataset used to train our
# predictive models and the function used to evaluate the resulting operational
# decisions. Then, we design a few machine learning based decision system of
# increasing sophistication and compare their business performance to baselines
# and oracle decisions on held out data.
#
# ## The credit card dataset
#
# The dataset is available on OpenML at the [following URL](
# https://openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&id=1597).
#
# We have a local copy of the dataset in the `datasets` folder. Let's load the
# parquet file and check the data that we have at hand.

# Explicitly import pyarrow since it is an optional dependency of pandas to
# trigger the fetching when using JupyterLite with pyodide kernel. Note this is
# an unnecessary (but harmless) import if you are not using JupyterLite with
# pyodide.

credit_card.info()

# %% [markdown]
#
# The target column is the "Class" column. It informs us whether a transaction
# is fraudulent (class 1) or legitimate (class 0).
#
# We see a set of features that are anonymized starting with "V". Looking at
# the dataset description in OpenML, we learn that those features are the
# result of a PCA transformation. The only non-transformed features are the
# "Time" and "Amount" columns. The "Time" corresponds to the number of seconds
# elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
# The "Amount" is the amount of the transaction.
#
# We first extract the target column from the other columns used as inputs to
# our predictive model:

# %%
target_name = "Class"
data = credit_card.drop(columns=target_name)
target = credit_card[target_name].astype(int)

# %% [markdown]
#
# The credit card fraud detection problem also has a special characteristic: the
# dataset is highly imbalanced. We can check the distribution of the target to
# confirm this.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
#
# The dataset is highly imbalanced with fraudulent transaction representing only 0.17%
# of the data. Since we are interested in training a machine learning model, we should
# also make sure that we have enough samples in the minority class to train the model
# by looking at the absolute number of samples.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
#
# We observe that we have around 500 samples that is on the low end of the number of
# samples required to train a machine learning model. In addition of the target
# distribution, we check the distribution of the amount of the legitimate and fraudulent
# separately transactions.

# %% [markdown]
#
# We cannot conclude a particular pattern in the distribution of the amount of the
# transactions apart from the fact that the fraudulent transactions tend to not have
# really large amounts. This information could be useful: if we train a predictive
# model on these data, we should consider that we do not know how our predictive model
# will behave on fraudulent transactions with large amounts in the future. It might be
# worth considering to have a specific treatment for those transactions.
#
# ## Addressing the problem with a business metric
#
# Now, we create the business metric that depends on the amount of each transaction.
#
# The gain of a legitimate transaction is quite easy to define since it is a
# commission that the operator receives. Here, we define it to be 2% of the
# amount of the transaction. Similarly, there is no gain in refusing a
# fraudulent transaction: the operator does not receive money from external
# actors or clients in this case.
#
# Defining a cost for refusing a legitimate transaction or accepting a
# fraudulent transaction is more complex. If the operator accepts a fraudulent
# transaction, it loses the amount of the transaction. There is also an extra
# cost involved that we define as the sum of several other costs: the cost of
# the fraud investigation, the cost of the customer support, and the cost
# related to brand reputation damage. Those additional costs should be
# specified by the data scientist in collaboration with the business
# stakeholders. A similar approach should be taken for the cost of refusing a
# legitimate transaction: the cost of customer support and the cost of a
# customer churning multiplied by estimated contribution of rejecting a
# legitimate transaction on churning.

# %%
# Commission received for each accepted legitimate transaction
commission_transaction_gain = 0.02
# Expected extra cost of accepting a fraudulent transaction
avg_accept_fraud_cost = 20
# Expected cost of refusing a legitimate transaction
avg_refuse_legit_cost = 10

# returned by its `predict_proba` method are as accurate as possible, irrespectively of
# the choice of the value of the decision threshold.

# %% [markdown]
#
# The business metric shows that our predictive model with a default decision threshold
# is already winning over the baseline in terms of profit and it would be already
# beneficial to use it to accept or reject transactions instead of accepting all
# transactions.
#
# ### Tuned logistic regression with optimal decision threshold
#
# From the research paper from Charles Elkan [1], we know that the optimal decision
# threshold can be computed given the following two assumptions:
#
# - the probabilistic classifier is well-calibrated,
# - the business metric can be expressed as a cost matrix.
#
# When defining our business metric, we have already expressed it as a cost matrix. So
# to use the approach described in [1], we only need to check the calibration of our
# model. In the previous section, we already tuned the hyperparameter of the logistic
# regression using a proper scoring rule that should help towards getting a
# well-calibrated model. As a first step, we assume that our classifier is
# well-calibrated. Later, we will add an extra calibration step to check if it improves
# the performance of our model in terms of the business metric.
#
# The optimal decision threshold proposed by Charles Elkan in [1] is defined as
# follows:

# %%


def elkan_optimal_threshold(amount):
    """Compute the Elkan-optimal threshold for a given amount.

    The values are expressed as costs. Therefore, the diagonal entries of the cost
    matrix (C_00 and C_11) are negative values and the off-diagonal values are positive.
